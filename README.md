# About

This was mostly a weekend project that I made for fun. I usually come back to discord.py projects to see where I can improve upon how I used to make discord bots. I like to call these projects markers of progress. This time around I took some inspiration from my current internship where I'm using LLM AI to create an chat bot that interacts with the company's data. I attempted to make a bot that would replicate how I sometimes think about random things throughout the day.
