# About

This was mostly a weekend project that I made for fun. I usually come back to discord.py projects to see where I can improve upon how I used to make discord bots. I like to call these projects markers of progress. This time around I took some inspiration from my current internship where I'm using LLM AI to create an chat bot that interacts with the company's data. I attempted to make a bot that would replicate how I sometimes think about random things throughout the day. 

# Enviornment Variables
```shell
# required
TOKEN="discord_token"
OPENAI_API_KEY="openai_key"
COMMAND_PREFIX="!"
DUMP_CHANNEL="channel_id"
ABOUT_ME="Some about me..."

# optional
UPDATE_WAIT="hours_to_wait_between_status_change" # defaults to 18 hours
CONFIM_EMOTE_ID="emote_id" # used to confirm killing the bot
```
